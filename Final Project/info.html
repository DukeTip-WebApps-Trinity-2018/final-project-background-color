        <h4>When We Originated</h4>
        <p class="column">We originated in the 1850's expecting to be a small family company, something that would have just enough profit
            to support us, and nothing more. But here we are now in the 2000's and we are still going strong, and the most
            important is the fact that we are still a family company.</p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="column">
        <h4>Our Founder</h4>
        <p>Our founder is none other than our great-grandfather, Sir Binary. He was a loyal protector of the King, Richie III.
            He created the company when he was going out to a war he wasn't sure he would come back from. He pooled all of
            his savings and then gave it to his wife(my great-grandmother), and told her what to do with the money. Because
            Sir Binary was their only source of money, she decided to follow his instructions. Unluckily, Sir Binary was
            correct in his assumption of not coming back, for he died a heroes death on the battlefield. The reimbursement
            money came back to the wife, and by that time she had the company up and running, my grandma and grandpa both
            helped her run this buisness, and eventually, here we are now. </p>

        <h4>Why do We Exist</h4>
        <p>As explained before, this company was created for many reasons, one of which was to be a backline profit generator.
            One other one would be so that many others in this town, were lacking the proper hydration, and often wanted
            a place to rest and work at the same time, but at the same time, no other places like this were around. So when
            this company was created, it was also to help people get what they wanted, and also bring joy aand happiness
            to their lives.</p>

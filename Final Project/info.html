        <h4> When We Originated</h4>
        <p>We originated in the 1850's expecting to be a small family company, something that would have just enough profit
            to support us, and nothing more. But here we are now in the 2000's still going strong and most importantly, the
            fact that we are still a family company.</p>

        <h4>Our Founder</h4>
        <p>Our founder is none other than our great-grandfathers, Sir Binary and Richie III. They were loyal friends and both
            had a wonderful idea to open up a Cafe. They created the idea of a company when they sat down for a cup of coffee
            and saw a cute kitten walk past them. They figured having a pet cat in their soon to be Cafe would bring joy
            to their customers. Soon enough, they opened a small company due to money issues; they had hope that this would
            help them with financial problems. Now, here we are a well running company that brings joy to our customers.</p>

        <h4>Why do We Exist</h4>
        <p>As explained before, this company was created for many reasons. One reason was to be a backline profit generator.
            Another one was it to help people get what they wanted and bring joy and happiness to their lives. To add on,
            many people in this town were lacking the proper hydration, and often wanted a place to rest and work.that is
            why this company was created. </p>
